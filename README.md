# audiotest - a sample audio recording javascript app

To update the list of word prompts, edit the `stimuli` variable in
`js/recorder.js`.

To set up the file upload location change the `$uploads_dir` variable in
`upload.php`. You will also need to make sure the location is writable
by the upload handler.
